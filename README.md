# Discord-KaiOS-Unofficial
Unofficial Discord client for KaiOS devices (tested on Cingular Flip IV on 2.5.3). Also technically works in the browser (briefly tested in Firefox 45 on Windows XP), but such configurations are unsupported.
 
Note that using this is technically against Discord's TOS, and that I take no responsibility for what they do about it.
